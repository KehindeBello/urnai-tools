# Agents

The main purpose of a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent is to learn by interacting with the environment. This is accomplished through a reward function, which tells our agent whether an action he took in a certain state was good or not. An agent's success is determined by how well it can learn its reward function and by how good it is at solving the examined problem.

The shape of a reward function is also heavily influenced by two things: The agent's representation of the environment, also known as the State, and the actions it can perform. In URNAI-Tools, we allow the user to create its own reward function, state representations, and to pick which actions he wants his agent to perform. These things can be accomplished through the use of [RewardBuilders](https://github.com/pvnetto/URNAI-Tools/tree/master/urnai/agents/rewards), [StateBuilders](https://github.com/pvnetto/URNAI-Tools/tree/master/urnai/agents/states) and [ActionWrappers](https://github.com/pvnetto/URNAI-Tools/tree/master/urnai/agents/actions), respectively.

But even if your rewards, states and actions are good enough, some problems can only be solved by using the correct algorithm. That's why we've also allowed users to give agents any DRL model they want without having to make any changes to states, rewards, actions or the model itself. In URNAI-Tools all of these elements are very modular and only need to be plugged to the agent to work.

To summarize, one of the main advantages of using URNAI-Tools to develop a DRL agent is that it's very easy to change an agent's reward function, state representation, list of possible actions and DRL model. This allows the user to iterate very fast and discover what works and what doesn't.


## Using an existing agent

First of all, before using an agent, you have to make sure that the environment you're going to use is supported by URNAI, so check the [env](https://github.com/pvnetto/URNAI-Tools/tree/master/urnai/envs) section. If the environment is supported, there is also an agent class for it, so all you have to do is either implement a [RewardBuilder](https://github.com/pvnetto/URNAI-Tools/tree/master/urnai/agents/rewards), [StateBuilder](https://github.com/pvnetto/URNAI-Tools/tree/master/urnai/agents/states), [ActionWrapper](https://github.com/pvnetto/URNAI-Tools/tree/master/urnai/agents/actions) and [DRL model](https://github.com/pvnetto/URNAI-Tools/tree/master/urnai/models), or use any of the existing ones. You'll probably want to implement a RewardBuilder and StateBuilder, since those are highly problem dependant and the default ones don't provide good enough info to your agent, but the default ActionWrapper for the environment you've chosen is probably good enough for solving it, and unless you want to use a model that URNAI-Tools doesn't support, it's better to use the ones we provide, since they've already been tested and can be parameterized to your needs.

After choosing the StateBuilder, RewardBuilder, ActionWrapper and DRL model you're going to use, all you have to do is instantiate them and pass them to the agent's constructor.

The following example is from our agent that solves Gym's Cartpole-v1:
```
from agents.gym_agent import GymAgent
from agents.actions.gym_wrapper import GymWrapper
from agents.rewards.default import PureReward
from agents.states.gym import PureState
from models.dqn_keras import DQNKeras

# Instantiating the State Builder
state_builder = PureState(env)

# Instantiating an ActionWrapper
action_wrapper = GymWrapper(env)

# Instantiating a Deep Q-Learning model. The StateBuilder and ActionWrapper are used as
# parameters of the model, since they control the model's input and output dimensions
dq_network = DQNKeras(action_wrapper,
                      state_builder,
                      'urnai/models/saved/cartpole_dql_working',
                      gamma=0.95, epsilon_decay=0.995, epsilon_min=0.1)

# Instantiating a RewardBuilder
reward_builder = PureReward()

# Initializing our Gym cartpole agent
agent = GymAgent(dq_network, reward_builder)
```


## Implementing a new agent

You'll usually want to implement a new agent when you're supporting a new environment. All you have to do is create a new class for your agent and extend from [urnai.agents.base.abagent.Agent](https://github.com/pvnetto/URNAI-Tools/blob/master/urnai/agents/base/abagent.py) and implement its abstract methods. You'll notice that some methods like build_state, get_reward, get_state_dim, reset and learn are already implemented in the base class, that's because these methods are assumed to work equally for every agent. In the sections below we'll explain what each method from the base class does and what you should pay attention to when implementing/overriding them.


### __init__(self, model: LearningModel, reward_builder: RewardBase)

#### Parameters:

- model: The DRL model used by the agent. The model contains references to the StateBuilder and ActionWrapper used by the agent. This must be an instance of the [urnai.models.base.abmodel.LearningModel](https://github.com/pvnetto/URNAI-Tools/blob/master/urnai/models/base/abmodel.py) class.
- reward_builder: The agent's reward function. This parameter must be an instance of the [urnai.agents.rewards.abreward.RewardBase](https://github.com/pvnetto/URNAI-Tools/blob/master/urnai/agents/rewards/abreward.py) class

#### What it does:
The constructor method from the base class is responsible for setting many important variables for the agent, including the StateBuilder and ActionWrapper, which are references obtained from the model, so it should always be called from the derived class' constructor.


### build_state(self, obs)

#### Parameters:
- obs: An observation from the environment. For more info, check the [env](https://github.com/pvnetto/URNAI-Tools/tree/master/urnai/envs) section.

#### What it does:
This method is already implemented in the base class, and it simply returns the build_state method from the agent's StateBuilder.


### get_reward(self, obs, reward, done)

#### Parameters:
- obs: An observation from the environment. For more info, check the [env](https://github.com/pvnetto/URNAI-Tools/tree/master/urnai/envs) section.
- reward: The reward given by the environment when the agent performs an action. **Don't confuse it with the agent's reward**.
- done: Boolean value returned from the environment that tells whether the current match/episode has finished or not.

#### What it does:
This method is already implemented in the base class, and it simply returns the get_reward method from the agent's RewardBuilder.


### get_state_dim(self)

#### What it does:
This method is already implemented in the base class, and it simply returns the get_state_dim method from the agent's StateBuilder.


### reset(self)

#### What it does:
This method is already implemented in the base class. It's called in the start of a new episode or match, and it's responsible for resetting some of the agent's variables, as well as the ActionWrapper. This method should be overidden whenever you want to reset something else at the start of an episode/match, but it's important that the derived class still calls this method from the base class.


### learn(self, obs, reward, done)

#### Parameters:
- obs: An observation from the environment. For more info, check the [env](https://github.com/pvnetto/URNAI-Tools/tree/master/urnai/envs) section.
- reward: The reward given by the environment when the agent performs an action. **Don't confuse it with the agent's reward**.
- done: Boolean value returned from the environment that tells whether the current match/episode has finished or not.

#### What it does:
This method is already implemented in the base class. It's called in every episode step right after an action is performed on the environment, and it's responsible for calling the learn method from the agent's model.

#### Keep in mind:
The step method receives obs, reward and done from the environment **before** the action is performed, and this method receives these parameters **after** the action is performed. Train works by using a (state, action, reward, next state) tuple, so in this scenario, the fact that step receives an observation from before the action is performed means it builds state and returns action, and the fact that learn receives an observation from the environment after the action was performed means it can build next state and calculate the reward. This is what guarantees that the training works.


### step(self, obs, reward, done)

#### Parameters:
- obs: An observation from the environment. For more info, check the [env](https://github.com/pvnetto/URNAI-Tools/tree/master/urnai/envs) section.
- reward: The reward given by the environment when the agent performs an action. **Don't confuse it with the agent's reward**.
- done: Boolean value returned from the environment that tells whether the current match/episode has finished or not.

#### What it does:
This is an abstract method that must be implemented by your agent. It's responsible for getting an action index from the agent's model and returning it. To do so, this method should build the current state of the environment, which is used by the model to choose an action.

#### Keep in mind:
The learn method receives obs, reward and done from the environment **after** the action is performed, and this method receives these parameters **before** the action is performed. Train works by using a (state, action, reward, next state) tuple, so in this scenario, the fact that step receives an observation from before the action is performed means it builds state and returns action, and the fact that learn receives an observation from the environment after the action was performed means it can build next state and calculate the reward. This is what guarantees that the training works.

It's also important to note that this method should set the agent's self.previous_action parameter to the action index that it will return, and self.previous_state to the state used to choose this action.

### play(self, obs)

#### Parameters:
- obs: An observation from the environment. For more info, check the [env](https://github.com/pvnetto/URNAI-Tools/tree/master/urnai/envs) section.

#### What it does:
This is an abstract method that must be implemented by your agent. This works just like step, but instead of simply getting an action index from the model, it should make the model predict an action index, instead of using an exploration/exploitation method. More details on the [urnai.models](https://github.com/pvnetto/URNAI-Tools/tree/master/urnai/models).

#### Keep in mind:
This method should set the agent's self.previous_action parameter to the action index it's going to return.
