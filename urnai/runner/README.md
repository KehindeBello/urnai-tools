# Command Line Interface (CLI)

The command line interface is available when URNAI is installed using pip. There are a set of commands with optional parameters that can be used to help the user with agent training. Basically, all these commands are distributed in labeled sets. For example, all training related commands are available under the 'train' label. So, the main concept behind URNAI CLI is to always call ``urnai <set-name``. 

For a full list of command sets and their parameters, use: ``urnai -h``.
