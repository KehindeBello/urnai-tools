# Utils
This module is a small collection of functions and classes used throughout the library to do simple transformations and other general tasks.

### Agent_utils

In this file we have a few functions to do coordinate transformations and lists encoding.

### Logger

This is our logger class, where we combine all information from Agent training and transform that into compreehensive graphs and charts.
