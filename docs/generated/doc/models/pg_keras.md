## Class PGKeras

## Method __init__()

* Arguments: action_wrapper, state_builder, learning_rate, gamma, name, build_model

## Method make_model()

* No Arguments.

## Method custom_loss()

* Arguments: y_true, y_pred

## Method memorize()

* Arguments: state, action, reward

## Method learn()

* Arguments: s, a, r, s_, done

## Method compute_discounted_R()

* Arguments: R

## Method choose_action()

Choose Sction for policy gradient is equal as predict.
Since there is no explore probability, all actions will come from the Net's weights.

* Arguments: state, excluded_actions

## Method save_extra()

* Arguments: persist_path

## Method load_extra()

* Arguments: persist_path

## Method predict()

model.predict returns an array of arrays, containing the Q-Values for the actions. 
This function uses the action probabilities from our policy to randomly select an action

* Arguments: state, excluded_actions

## Method ep_reset()

* No Arguments.
